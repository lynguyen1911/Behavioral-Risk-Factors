# Behavioral-Risk-Factors
This project's research questions are: 
1) Can we predict whether a person has a mental health issue based on his/her general health, age and BMI? 
2) Is there any significant association between the per-day consumption of vegetables and fruit with the risk of having diabetes? 
3) Can we predict the risk of being overweight/obese based on chronic health conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes), mental health, physical activities and age? 

To find out the answer, the BRFSS 2021 dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html) was explored using Python. Data cleaning was performed after, and finally, Machine learning models were built to answer each research question. 

The answer to research questions based on research results:
1) The model shows mental health disorders are more prevalent in people with poor and fair general health, while people with good general health are less likely to experience mental health problems. 
2) There is hardly any association between the total amount of fruit and vegetable per day and the risk of having diabetes. 
3) The results also showed that diabetes, high blood pressure, and age are essential attributes to use when classifying people with or without being overweight/obese.

More detailed analysis and results are presented in the report.
